Watch [site's repo](https://github.com/b-init/b-init.github.io) on github for updates. I've also managed to add a comment section that embeds the repo's github discussions here as comments down below! You'll need to sign in through your github id to use it though.

## Frequently Asked Questions (I presume)

<!-- &nbsp; -->
### Why does this exist?

I like to write, I decided.

### Why does this site look like sh\*t?


This site is inspired from the old internet and the ugliness (if you think so) is (partly) intentional. I have not lived through the early days of the internet^ and never will. But from what I've learnt, a lot of these old sites were made as a way to mess around with this new technology, to look unique and personal, to *just have fun...* Sure it may have been functionally worse and slow and epislepsy-inducing but there were also no cookies or tracking to worry about. I hope to bring a little bit of that vibe here (although maybe I shouldn't since I might wanna make this some kind of a *professional* portfolio at some point).

I am also limited by static site generators' theme selection and my unwillingness to learn webdev.

^ defititely been through some of it, back when you'd have 2G internet and flash games were a thing...
